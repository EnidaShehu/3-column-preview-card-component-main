### Useful resources

- [Grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) - The Grid system article helped me make the containers. It's built with flexbox and is fully responsive.
- [Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/) - Bootstrap includes several predefined button styles which helped me create the buttons for this project. I added an extra class to each button to get as close to the design as possible.
